A miniature self-contained power station, complete with the inconsistency of use.  While the modern flashlight is an efficient solution to the problem, it tends to have a cold and brittle light which is displeasing to me.  This electric lantern seems to waft in the breeze, and glows with a carefully selected color.  The brightness is controlled by LFOs and envelopes, tuned to variably oscillate and quell in a lazy rolling flicker.","</p>"],"entry":"An Electric Lantern"}]},{"section":"Hardware","entries":[{"data":["<p>","The lantern consists of the following parts.","</p>","<ul>","<li>Craft lantern housing</li>","<li>SAMD21 breakout</li>","<li>Neopixel ring</li>","<li>5V1A charger/booster</li>","<li>1000mAh battery</li>","<li>WS2812 ring</li>"],"entry":"Parts"},{"data":["The schematic is not yet available."],"entry":"Schematic"}]},{"section":"Firmware","entries":[{"data":["The firmware is an example in the ","<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/sparkfun/PixelGL/tree/master/library/PixelGL\">PixelGL library</a>.
